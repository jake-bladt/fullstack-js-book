# Chapter 1: Feral Javascript and how to tame it

## A Brief History of Javascript
Javascript was first released as a client-side scripting that ran in the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September of 1995. Based on a seemingly impossible litany of management demands, language designer Brendan Eich created the entire language in ten days, drawing largely from SmallTalk and LISP and bolting on a syntax that looks like Java, but behaves in ways that are both subtly and grotesquely different from its namesake language.

As a result, for the last twenty years, everyone who writes or talks about Javascript feels the need at some point to say, "Javascript is not Java." In fact, it's not even close.
